neutrino
========

A light, expandable and full featured image analysis tool for research


Rationale
---------

*Neutrino* is an image viewer/analyser meant to be a research tool for manipulating experimental images. On a more general basis each bi-dimensional matrix of elements in the real or in the complex field can be seen as an image

Features
--------

Neutrino includes:

* multiple windows, multiple buffer support.
* internal **python** interpreter, able to access the entire code structure *runtime*
* common lossless input formats (including txt, netpbm, tiff, fits, hdf, raw), proprietary formats (Andor SIF, Pixelfly PCO, Fujitsu/Siemens FLA) and other common formats (as supported by QImage).
* **txt** output format and proprietary binary format for image or session save
* vectorial export formats (pdf, svg)

Image visualization/interaction:

* lineouts
* multiple colormaps
* powerful magnification tools

Included analysis tools:

* Interferometry (via 2D Wavelet analysis)
* VISAR analysis
* Integral inversions
* Fourier Analysis
