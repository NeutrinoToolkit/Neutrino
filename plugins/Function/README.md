We implemented 2 functions: 
 
 - `img(x,y)` will return the current image value of pixel `(x,y)`
 - `phys(num,x,y)` will return the value of pixel `(x,y)` of the `num` image
 - `id(num,x,y)` will return the value of pixel `(x,y)` of the image with uuid `num`
 
There are also 2 values:

 - `width` : width of the new image
 - `height` : height of the new image
