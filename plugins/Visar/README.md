VISAR analysis
==============

In the Window there are 3 main tabs on the left : *Settings*, *Velocity* and
*SOP*

In the main toolbar you can add <img src="../../resources/icons/plus.png" width="16" /> more visars or remove if there are too many <img src="../../resources/icons/remove.png" width="16" />

The main tabs on the laft are *Settings* (for parameters that you just have to change once) and *Velocity* (to tune the velocity measurements (e.g. jumps and delays)

Settings :
----------

For each *Visar* tab to set the parameters:

  * Select the *Reference* and the *Shot* images
  * With your mouse, select the ROI in the main window (the phase is taken from the middle
    of the ROI, while the intensity is averaged over the entire ROI)
  * Get the *Carrier* (orientation and interfringe): hit on the button <img src="refresh2.png" width="16" />
    (adjusting the *weight* if the values are not correct, to remove
    either the lower frequencies or the higher frequencies)    
  * set the *Center*, *Magnifgication* if you want to have absolute space references
  * set the *Slit* parameter (in px) is corresponding to the
    width of the Gaussian part of the Morlet function in the direction
    of the fringes, i.e. the time direction (this might weel reasonably be the height of the slit when the streak camera is in focus mode).
  * Fit the interference fringes by hitting <img src="refresh.png" width="16" />
  * Adjust the *intensity parameters*: 
  
      * adjust the background *offset* (background noise level). To estimate its value, read on the image directly on an appropriate area (long time after the shock for example or on the side where fringes are usually not present).
      * adjust the *Pixel delay* between the reference and the shot (in case of probe jitter).
      * adjust the *ref* (Refence multiplication factor) to have the blue curves: ref (dashed line) and the shot (full line), at the same level (to correct from the shot-to-shot fluctuations of the probe laser energy). This in mandatory for the reflectivity measurement.
      * The sensitivity (Velocity/fringe). In the **Notes** tab you can find a simple sensitivity calculator based on the etalon parameters (thickness, wavelength, refractive index and delta correction for refractive index)      
      * **Sweep Time** is the temporal calibration of the streak camera. The is a list of values ($A_1$ ... $A_n$) as defined by th Hamamatsu cameras (i.e $T(X)=A_1x+A_2 X^2 /2+A_3 X^3 /3+...+A_n X^n /n$). One value is linear response.

Velocity:
---------

For each *Visar* tab to set the velocity parameters:

  * Specify the 
    o *Delay* of the shot to the initial synchronization shot 
    o *t0* Pixel position of the synchronization
  * The *Offset* is for a fine adjustment of the fringe position between the reference and the shot. This is adjusted automatically. The automatic value is displayed. If needed (when the value of the velocity at negative time is not at 0), an additional offset can be set manually.
  * The *Reflectivity* window allows to precise the real value of the reflectivity.
     o *material* To set the real value of the reflectivity of the used material
     o *ghost* In case you have a windows patially reflecting in front of the shock
  * *Jumps* To correct the jumps of fringes In case of a jump, both Visars wonâ€™t have the same velocity. Here the objective is to apply a
    correction and obtain the 2 same velocities:
    
     * Three parameters need to be adjusted and:
         1. t = time for the beginning of the velocity change (in pixel).
         2. i = number of jumps to correct for (defined by step 6.1)
         3. [n0] = index of refraction. This is optional.
     * This set of parameters is set for each jump. As an example "`0 3; 3.5 5 1.7`", means:
         1. a first change of velocity at the time `0` with a jump of `3` fringes (no refractive index means `1`)
         2. a second change of velocity at the time `3.5` with a jump of `5` fringes in a medium with refractive index of `1.7`.

Temperaure:
-----------

  *  Select *Reference* and *Shot* images. In case only shot image is present it will use the same on bot combo-box and use the *background* spin-box to adjust the background level
  *  set the pixel *time zero* and the delay *delta t*
  *  set *Center* and *magnification* as explained above.
  *  Choose the *refelectiviy*:
     1. *Vx*: Visar number `x`
     3. *Mean* of all visars at that time
     4. *Zero*: no reflectivity (Blackbody temperature)
  *  **Sweep Time**: conversion px to time (same as above with Hamamatsu polynomial expansion)
  *  Direction: **H**orizontal or **V**ertical
  *  SOP calibration: **$T_0$** and **A** : calibration values ($T_0$ is the color temperature of the light collected by optical system and "A" is the efficiency of the streak).
